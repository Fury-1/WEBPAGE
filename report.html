<!--<h1>RESULT AND DISCUSSION</h1>
<p id="try">PCU value for junction Traffic flow is computed by the using Traffic volume count survey data. The peak hour is held from 08:30 am to 09:30 am which is also obtained by survey. The peak volume per hour is computed, that will be taken from hourly peak hours. The peak hour factor is calculated as 0.9452. Then the volume/capacity ratio is found as 4.658 based on this value, the level of service of this junction is computed as “F”. To improve this, some suggestions are suggested</p>

<br>

<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
<p id="try">junction has been analyzed by volume count survey (manual method). Based on the survey, Passenger Car Unit has found and the Level Of Service has found by volume/capacity ratio. Then the junction has come under Level Of Service F, based on volume/capacity ratio. To improve this junction, some suggestions have suggested..</p>

<br>

<h1>SUGGESTIONS</h1>
<p id="try">Followings are the some suggestions have granted to improve that existing road junction.<br>
		&#8226; Increase the width of the road – by increasing the width of the road, increase the capacity of the junction. And the volume / capacity ratio is decreased. Hence the LOS is improved<br>
&#8226; Improve the lateral clearance – by improve the lateral clearance, the visibility of the user is improved. Hence it will increase the free flow of the junction which results in decrease the accident rate.<br>
&#8226; By providing effective public transport system, the private transport will be diverted with the public transports which enhance the free flow with high capacity.
